    DESCRIPTION 
          " 
          This MIB contains managed object definitions for
          encapsulating TDM (T1,E1, T3, E3, NxDS0) as
          pseudo-wires over packet-switching networks (PSN).

          This MIB supplements the PW-STD-MIB as in: Zelig, D.,
          Nadeau,T. 'Pseudo Wire (PW) Management Information Base'.
          The PW-STD-MIB contains structures and MIB associations
          generic to Pseudo-Wire (PW) emulation. PW-specific
          MIBs (such as this) contain config and stats for specific
          PW types.

          Initial version, published as draft-ietf-pwe3-TDM-mib-00.txt
          by the 'Pseudo-Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3)
          Working Group'

          This version was taken from a snapshot of 
          draft-ietf-pwe3-pw-tdm-mib-04.txt 
          (by Orly Nicklass as noted below)  and modified by David Brief and 
          Ron Cohen of Resolute Networks to be rooted 
          in the under DOCSIS projects in the CableLabs 
          private enterprises branch. The intention is to 
          support the standard MIBs when they reach RFC status.

          -Stray packets MAY be detected by the PSN and multiplexing
          layers. Stray packets MUST be discarded by the CE-bound IWF
          and their detection MUST NOT affect mechanisms for detection
          of packet loss.

          -Malformed packets are detected by mismatch between the
          expected packet size (taking the value of the L bit into
          account) and the actual packet size inferred from the PSN and
          multiplexing layers. Malformed in-order packets MUST be
          discarded by the CE-bound IWF and replacement data generated

          as for lost packets.

          -Excessive packet loss rate is detected by computing the
          average packet loss rate over the value of
          teaPwTDMAvePktLossTimeWindow and comparing it with a
          preconfigured threshold [SATOP].

          -Buffer overrun is detected in the normal operation state
          when the CE bound IWF's jitter buffer cannot accommodate
          newly arrived packets.

          -Remote packet loss is indicated by reception of packets with
          their R bit set.

          -Packet misorder is detected by looking at the Sequence
          number provided by the control word.

          -TDM Fault, if L bit in the control word is set, it indicates
          that TDM data carried in the payload is invalid due an
          attachment circuit fault.  When the L bit is set the payload
          MAY be omitted in order to conserve bandwidth.
